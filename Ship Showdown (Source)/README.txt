Ship Showdown

This is a 2 player game where players try to shoot each other down. Their control on their ship and their timing while firing shots determines victory or defeat.


1. Python is required to run the game.
2. To start the game, run "Ship Showdown.py".
3. This is an experimental prototype, but was never finished. Features originally planned were as follows:

 - Better key mapping for two players
 - More frames for the ship graphics
 - Environment dynamics (fighting around a blackhole draws both ships towards it, fighting in asteroid field damages ships)
 - Powerups and shield system
 - More realistic ship movement (fine tune friction, etc)
 - Animated backgrounds for more involvement
 - High score system
 - Tournament system
 - 2 game modes: "Asteroid"esque, and Linear (which is that the game has now).
 - Ability to choose orientation (horizontal/vertical) while playing in Linear mode.
